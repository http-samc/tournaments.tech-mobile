The best debate rankings on the go 🏃‍♂️

## What is it?
[tournaments.tech](http://tournaments.tech) is the largest and most accurate debate ranking system. We made this resource because there were no holistic rankings for the public forum national circuit, and existing record curations fail to collect sufficient quality data. Our speedy API delivers you the results from the latest national circuit tournaments just minutes after they occur, and you can stay up to date with instant push notifications. You can use our automated bid list (with ghost bid support) to check your progress on qualifying for the Tournament of Champions. Or, just run a quick search to get intel on your next opponent!
